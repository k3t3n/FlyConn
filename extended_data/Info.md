## Excel Files

`ARI.xlsx` : Pairwise ARI values for different combinations of parameter choices.

`labels.xlsx` : Assigned labels for each connectivity-based class. Additional sheets include supplemental data calculated for each class, along with a summary of the procedure used to assign the corresponding labels.

## Movie

`critical_period_v1.mp4` : The clip consists of 10 circuits, each corresponding to one day. This clip tracks the growth (and activity) of the circuit over the span of 10 days. If a node in the circuit has no birthed neurons until that particular day, then that node is "grayed out" and considered to be as yet inactive (unborn). For each day, the nodes that exhibit a critical growth period are colored, and so are the critical edges.

`critical_period_v2.mp4` : Similar to clip one but instead of each day, it shows circuit growth grouped into four time periods, (i) embryo, (ii) early (day1-day3), (iii) mid (day4-day6), and (iv) late (day7-day9).
